      description: `We are delighted to share the highlights of an exciting event organized by SoftDesk, where esteemed SoftDesk advisor Sir Ali Javed, who is also an eminent researcher and a renowned figure in the SED Department conducted a hands-on workshop on Deepfakes. Deepfakes are a revolutionary technology that combines artificial intelligence and image manipulation. They allow users to alter or superimpose one person's face onto another's in videos or images, creating incredibly realistic yet synthetic content. On June 5, 2023, students gathered with their laptops to delve into the fascinating world of Deepfakes under the guidance of Sir Ali Javed and his dedicated team. The event concluded with the distribution of participation certificates, a testament to the student’s active involvement and commitment. The certificates were presented by the esteemed chairman, recognizing the student’s valuable contributions and acknowledging their dedication to expanding their knowledge in this emerging field.`,
